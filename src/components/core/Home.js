          <p>Using Your Brain Efficiently: Focused Mode.</p>
          When you are concentrating on a certain topic or concept that youâ€™re
          trying to learn, your brain is in focused mode. In this mode, your
          brain works with familiar ideas to understand a topic in detail. For
          example, you could be studying a chapter and trying to learn the
          vocabulary terms. Your brain is making connections between familiar
          ideas to make sense of the concept. This can be considered the heavy
          lifting mode.
